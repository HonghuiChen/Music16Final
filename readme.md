## Description
Problem Domain: Music Player
We want our application to be a Music App, so the problem domain is music. 
We are thinking of developing an application that has several tools for music listeners. 
We want the user to create a profile that will store data like music genre preference, favorite artists, 
playlist history, etc. This data will be used for tools like a recommendation bar based on a userâ€™s history, 
a random playlist created from history/preferred genre, and many others.
We will use a Spotify API to pull the music data from.
SPOTIFY API: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
UML Class Diagram: https://lucid.app/lucidchart/8052a492-65b0-4020-a488-52c86f6cce3c/edit?viewport_loc=-6226%2C-4667%2C1719%2C1603%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_786dad9f-a510-4840-988c-b30398f3617e


There are a lot of features that the users can use in our Music App. For our new users, they are allow to create a new
account with a username and unique password. Once the users created the account, the existing users are allowed to log
in and log out their account whenever they want. These users are also able to modify their profile account based on
their own preferences. Their profile will have their username, password, favorite music genres, and favorite artists.
With this information, our Music App will be able to give songs recommendation to the users. Our users also get few
features more like, search for specific songs/albums, explore songs by genre, comment on specific songs, and lastly, the
users would be able to follow and connect with their friends.
