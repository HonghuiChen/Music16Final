## Description
Problem Domain: Music Player
We want our application to be a Music App, so the problem domain is music. 
We are thinking of developing an application that has several tools for music listeners. 
We want the user to create a profile that will store data like music genre preference, favorite artists, 
playlist history, etc. This data will be used for tools like a recommendation bar based on a userâ€™s history, 
a random playlist created from history/preferred genre, and many others.
We will use a Spotify API to pull the music data from.
